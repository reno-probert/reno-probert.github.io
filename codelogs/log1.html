	<h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>
        <h2>Differences Between Non-Semantic HTML and Semantic HTML</h2>
            <p>
            The central difference between non-semantic HTML and semantic HTML is in ease of navigation and searchability on the code itself. 
            While both forms of HTML serve the same purpose of getting information onto a webpage and providing structure, 
            semantic HTML allows a coder to use tags that are more descriptive of what is actually included in the content of the 
            webpage. Semantic HTML also allows for accessibility tools to better describe the content of a webpage and
            provides search engine optimization based on the tags.
            </p>
        <h3>Examples of Non-Semantic Tags</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;div&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;h1&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;b&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;i&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;img&gt;</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Examples of Semantic Tags</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;article&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;header&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;strong&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;em&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;figure&gt;</li>
            </ul>
    <p>Semantic HTML follows pretty much the same general structure as standard HTML but allows for better descriptions
        of the contents. For example if you wanted to add an image using semantic tags. Instead of something more abstract
        like &lt;img&gt; to contain your image link, you would use &lt;figure&gt;and rather than adding a non descriptive
        &lt;p&gt; tag underneath to describe the image, you could use &lt;figcaption&gt;which clearly notes that the text 
        is related to the image. See example below:</p>
    <textarea cols="70" rows="5"> 
        <figure>
            <img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">
            <figcaption>Caption for the image.</figcaption>
    </textarea>
    <p>In addition to the benefits of searchability, ease of navigation, and accessibility, semantic HTML does not have drawbacks
        as it works the same as regular HTML while providing the added benefits. Especially for people new to coding,
        semantic html can simplify coding and allow a coder to use better understandable terms to accomplish their goals.
