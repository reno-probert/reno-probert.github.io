    <h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>
    <h2>Absolute vs. Relative CSS Length Units</h2>
    <p>
        CSS length units are all used to define the sizes of various elements on a web page (i.e., fonts, margins,
        etc.). However, there are two main categories of CSS length units to choose from, absolute and relative.
    </p>
    <h3>Absolute Units</h3>
    <p>
        Absolute units are fixed units that do not change. They can provide an exact size for elements on a webpage and
        will remain that exact size regardless of the device or screen size being used to view the webpage. While this
        allows a web designer to have exactly the size they want, the design is not very responsive or adaptable and may
        result in elements displaying strangely or take away from the accessibility of the site. Examples of absolute
        units include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>px (pixels)</li>
        <li>pt (points)</li>
        <li>cm (centimeters)</li>
        <li>mm (millimeters)</li>
        <li>in (inches)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Relative Units</h3>
    <p>
        Relative units, on the other hand, will adjust based on the device or screen size being used to view the
        webpage. This allows for a more responsive design that can adapt to different screen sizes and
        improve accessibility. As the name suggests, the lengths listed lengths are 'relative' to the screen size or
        other elements on the page. This makes relative elements more flexible and thus better able to adapt to a
        variety of platforms. Examples of relative units include: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>em</li>
        <li>rem</li>
        <li>%</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Measuring Units Explained</h3>
    <h4> px and pt</h4>
        <p>Pixels (px) are a common absolute unit and are based on the screen resolution. They define the exact amount
            of pixels and element will take up on the screen. Points (pt) are used more in media that is meant to be
            printed but it essentially defines 1/72 of an inch. Both of these serve as exact units of measurement and
            will not change based on the size of the screen. Example:</p>
        <textarea cols="70" rows="4">
                p {
                    font-size: 16px;
                }
        </textarea>
        <h4> em and rem</h4>
        <p>Em is a relative unit that based on the font size of the element's parent element. Rem is similar but is
            instead relative to the root element. The size of the root or parent element is considered 1, so if you add
            an element like .5em, than the element will be one half the size of the parent element. This means that if
            the font size of the parent or root
            element changes, the size of elements using em or rem will also change. Example:</p>
        <textarea cols="70" rows="7">
                body {
                    font-size: 16px;
                }
                p {
                    font-size: 2em; (will be 32px)
                }
        </textarea>
        <h4> % </h4>
        <p>Percentages are also a relative unit and are based on a percentage of the size of the parent element. If a
            parent element was 200px wide, you could modify the child element by adding a percentage like 50% which
            would make the element into 100px wide. This allows elements to adapt to different screen sizes. Example:
        </p>
        <textarea cols="70" rows="7">
                section {
                    width: 200px;
                }
                p {
                    width: 50%; (will be 100px)
                }
        </textarea>
