    <h1>CSS Media Queries</h1>
    <h2>What are CSS Media Queries?</h2>
    <p>
        CSS Media Queries are a method used in web development and responsive design that allows a website to adapt to
        various screen sizes, browsers, and other viewing options that a user may utilize to view the site. CSS Media
        Queries can be coded in to make sure a website can be viewed properly to matter what device the user is using to
        view it and allows a web designer to create a better experience for users in terms of navigation and
        accessibility.
    </p>
    <h2>What does a CSS Media Querie Look like?</h2>
    <p>CSS Media Queries are coded into the CSS file of a website and can be used to adapt almost any CSS design element
        you could want from font-size to background color the site based on how the site is
        being viewed or interacted with or what it is being viewed on. Example:
    </p>
    <textarea cols="70" rows="5">
            @media (max-width: 500px) {
                body {
                    background-color: blue;
                }
            }
        </textarea>
    <p>In this example, the CSS Media Querie is set to change the background color of the website to blue if the
        device being used to view the site has a width of 500 pixels or less. </p>
    <h2>Other ways to use CSS Media Queries</h2>
    <p>CSS Media Queries can be used to change a variety of design elements on a website and can respond to a variety of
        different factors. Some other examples of how CSS Media Queries can be used include:
    <h3>Orientation</h3>
    <p>Like it sounds, CSS Media Queries can be used to adjust a website based on the orientation of the device or
        browser it is being viewed on. This is especially useful for sites being viewed on a device like a cell phone.
        Example: </p>
    <textarea cols="70" rows="5">
        @media (orientation: landscape) {
            body {
                font-size: 20px;
            }
        }
        </textarea>
    <p>In this example the font would change to 20px if the site was viewed in landscape orientation. </p>
    <p><strong>Other possible orientation values:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>portrait</li>
        <li>landscape</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interaction</h3>
    <p>CSS Media Queries can also be used to change a website based on how the user is interacting with it. This can
        make the website easier to navigate as well as add a level of interactivity and design to the site. Example:
    </p>
    <textarea cols="70" rows="5">
                @media (hover: hover) {
                     p:hover {
                        color: green;
                    }
            }
                </textarea>
    <p>In this example, the color of a paragraph would change to green when the user hovers over it with their mouse.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Other possible interaction values:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>none</li>
        <li>pointer</li>
        <ul>
            <li>coarse</li>
            <li>fine</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Resolution/Device Size</h3>
    <p>CSS Media Queries can also be used to change a website based on the resolution or the width and height of the device or browser it is
        being viewed on. Example:   
    </p>
    <textarea cols="70" rows="5">
        @media (min-resolution: 300dpi) {
            body {
                font-size: 25px;
            }
        }
        </textarea>
    <p>In this example, the font size would change to 25px if the device or browser being used to view the site has a resolution of 300dpi or higher. </p>
    <p><strong>Other possible resolution values:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>max-resolution</li>
        <li>min-width / max-width</li>
        <li>min-height / max-height</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>User Preferences</h3>
    <p>CSS Media Queries can also be used to change a website based on user preferences selected on the browser or device. This can be useful to keep design elements looking good no matter what display is being used as well as assisting with accessibility. Example:
    </p>
    <textarea cols="70" rows="5">
        @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
            body {
                background-color: black;
                color: white;
            }
        }
        </textarea>
    <p>In this example, the background color of the website would change to black and the text color would change to white if the user has selected a dark color scheme. </p>
    <p><strong>Other possible user preference values:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>prefers-reduced-motion</li>
        <li>prefers-contrast</li>
        <li>prefers-reduced-transparency</li>
    </ul>
