    <h1>Reference Quest</h1>
    <h2>How Different Coding Sites Explain the @media CSS Rule<h2>
            <p>
                For this project I searched for the CSS @media rule using the provided search bar on the following four
                coding reference sites:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@media">Mozilla
                        Developer Network aka MDN</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/atrule_media.php">W3Schools</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/m/media/">CSS-Tricks</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/search/?query=%40media">Free Code Camp</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What's the Difference?</h2>
            <h3>Term Searchability</h3>
            <p>All of the sites provided a search bar for looking up specific terms, however some of the results
                were easier to parse through than others. <strong>W3Schools</strong> and <strong>MDN</strong> took me
                straight to an easy to use page that included both detailed descriptions as well as examples of what the
                code should look like. <strong>CSS-Tricks</strong> also provided an
                in-depth explanation of the @media rule, but unfortunately the @media did not show up in their index of
                @ CSS terms under "M" so I did have to search around more. <strong>Free Code Camp</strong> provided a
                variety of articles and tutorials
                on the @media rule, but the results page was less focused and harder to find specific information as it
                is made up of different articles by different authors rather than one standard page of definitions of
                @media rules.
            </p>
            <h3>Clarity</h3>
            <p>All four sites provided clear explanations of the @media rule, but some were more beginner friendly than
                others. <strong>W3Schools</strong> provided an easy to understand explanation of
                the @media rule, along with simple examples that made it easy to grasp the concept quickly.
                <strong>MDN</strong> also provided a clear explanation, but it was more detailed and technical, which
                may be better suited for those with some prior knowledge of CSS. <strong>CSS-Tricks</strong> offered
                similarly
                detailed explanations to the prior two and included code samples for a large number of @media
                adjustments which
                would allow for a user to simply copy and paste or see very clearly what was required of them.
                <strong>Free Code Camp</strong>
                provided a variety of articles that catered to different skill
                levels, but the quality and clarity varied depending on the author.
            </p>
            <h3>Unique Features</h3>
            <p>Each site had its own unique features that set it apart from the others. <strong>W3Schools</strong> had
                interactive examples that allowed users to edit and test the code directly on the page.
                <strong>MDN</strong>includes many links and ways to get more in-depth information in addition to a large
                section on browser compatibility which was either not present in the other sites or far less detailed.
                <strong>CSS-Tricks</strong>
                has many different articles and tutorials as well as the previously mentioned clear code samples for
                the @media rule. <strong>Free Code Camp</strong> had a multitiude of community created articles, with
                user-contributed
                articles and tutorials showing more of the real-world applications of the @media
                rule.
            </p>
            <h2>What Does a Good Reference Site Need?</h2>
            <p>Based on my experience in using a variety of reference sites to clarify things in this class, I feel the
                following things every reference site should have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A clear and easy to use search function that takes you directly to the page you need based on the
                    term you are looking for.</li>
                <li>Clear explanations that are easy to understand for beginners but with easily accessible detailed
                    information for advanced users.</li>
                <li>Examples that are easy to follow and provide direct samples of the actual code that will be needed.
                </li>
                <li>Web design that allows for maximum readability. Don't hide great information in a wall of text.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What Stands Out?</h2>
            <p>Overall, all of the sites did well at providing the needed information. <strong>W3 Schools</strong> has a
                very strong design that provides clear information in a readable format that makes it very simple to
                navigate. <strong>CSS Tricks</strong> provides very clear samples of specific code for the different CSS
                properties that can be set up with the @media rule. <strong>MDN</strong> has an incredibly detailed
                database with a multitude of links, though it does suffer a little from less readability and design
                hierarchy than you would see in some of the other sites. To me the weakest references came from
                <strong>Free Code Camp</strong> as the community driven approach provides a lot of articles, you have to
                sift through them to find the information you actually need.</p>
            <p>If I were to rank these sites based on how helpful they are to myself, a beginning coder, I would order them as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>W3Schools</li>
                <li>CSS-Tricks</li>
                <li>MDN</li>
                <li>Free Code Camp</li>
            </ol>
