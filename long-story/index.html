                incredible depths.

                <img src="Weddel.jpg" alt="weddel seal" class="img">
                <p>Weddel seals are a relatively common species of seal that are able to hold their breath for more than
                    45
                    minutes when diving. Research has shown that weddel seals strategically plan their dives based on
                    light
                    for visual hunting.</p>

                <img src="Narwhal375.jpg" alt="narwhal" class="img">
                <p>Narwhals perform frequent deep dives for hunting purposes but mostly in the winter months. Scientists
                    have struggled to determine the exact reason for the narwhal's diving patterns but due to their
                    arctic
                    habitat, it is theorized that the pattern has to do with avoiding ice on the ocean surface.</p>

                    The
                    whales have massive oxygen reserves and are able to deep dive and hunt large prey including giant
                    squid.

                <p>Elephant seals are the deepest diving mammal that is not a whale. Elephant seals have specialized
                    cardiovascular systems that slow their heartrate and maintain oxygen levels in the blood allowing
                    them
                    to keep up oxygen levels while emptying their lungs to prevent depth related complications.</p>

                <p>The Cuvier's beaked whale holds the record for the deepest dive of any marine animal and can hold
                    it's
                    breath for over 3 hours. The whale has collapsable lungs that make it possible to deal with the
                    crushing
                    weight of deep water. There are multiple deep-diving beaked whales but the Cuvier's is the champion
                    diver by hundreds of meters.</p>
