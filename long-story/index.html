                and hold their breath for impressive lengths of time.

                <p>Sea Otters are the deepest diving mammals that are in the same family as seals or whales. Sea otters
                    regularly dive down to the ocean floor in order to hunt for shellfish.</p>

                <p>Thick-Billed Murre are the deepest diving bird that is not in the penguin family. Murre use their wings to propell through the water and are able to store oxygen in their muscles and blood rather than their lungs which reduces buoyancy.</p>

                    45
                    minutes when diving. Research has shown that weddel seals strategically plan their dives based on
                    light

                <p>Narwhals perform frequent deep dives for hunting purposes but mostly in the winter months. Scientists
                    have struggled to determine the exact reason for the narwhal's diving patterns but due to their
                    arctic habitat, it is theorized that the pattern has to do with avoiding ice on the ocean surface.

                <p>Sperm whales are able to reach incredible depths and are the largest deep diving mammal on this list.
                    The whales have massive oxygen reserves and are able to deep dive and hunt large, deep water prey
                    including giant

                <p>Elephant seals are the deepest diving mammal that is not a whale. Elephant seals have specialized
                    cardiovascular systems that slow their heartrate and maintain oxygen levels in the blood allowing
                    them to keep up oxygen levels while emptying their lungs to prevent depth related complications.
                    While sperm whales are more consistantly seen diving to depths of around 2,000 feet, the southern
                    elephant seal has been recorded as diving deeper than any known sperm whale by reaching the 2,338
                    meter mark.</p>

                <p>The Cuvier's beaked whale holds the record for the deepest dive of any marine animal and can hold
                    it's breath for over 3 hours. The whale has collapsable lungs that make it possible to deal with the
                    crushing weight of deep water. There are multiple deep-diving beaked whales to the point where half
                    of this list could be beaked whales of some variety, but the Cuvier's is the
                    champion diver by hundreds of meters.</p>
