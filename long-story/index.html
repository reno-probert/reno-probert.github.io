            <h3>Aquatic mammals all need to surface in order to breath air, but some mammals are able to dive to
                incredible depths.

                ocean they can reach.</h3>

            <h2>900 meters - Weddel Seal</h2>
            <img src="Weddel.jpg" alt="weddel seal" class="img">
            <p>Weddel seals are a relatively common species of seal that are able to hold their breath for more than 45
                minutes when diving. Research has shown that weddel seals strategically plan their dives based on light
                for visual hunting.</p>

            <h2>1,500 meters - Narwhal</h2>
            <img src="Narwhal375.jpg" alt="narwhal" class="img">
            <p>Narwhals perform frequent deep dives for hunting purposes but mostly in the winter months. Scientists
                have struggled to determine the exact reason for the narwhal's diving patterns but due to their arctic
                habitat, it is theorized that the pattern has to do with avoiding ice on the ocean surface.</p>

            <img src="marine-mammals-sperm-whale.jpg" alt="sperm whale" class="img">
            <p>Sperm whales are able to reach incredible depths and are the largest deep diving mammal on this list. The
                whales have massive oxygen reserves and are able to deep dive and hunt large prey including giant squid.

            <img src="venti-views-QQ6KXIDqqYU-unsplash.jpg" alt="elephant seal" class="img">
            <p>Elephant seals are the deepest diving mammal that is not a whale. Elephant seals have specialized
                cardiovascular systems that slow their heartrate and maintain oxygen levels in the blood allowing them
                to keep up oxygen levels while emptying their lungs to prevent depth related complications.</p>

            <img src="beaked-whale-640x327.jpg" alt="beaked whale" class="img">
            <p>The Cuvier's beaked whale holds the record for the deepest dive of any marine animal and can hold it's
                breath for over 3 hours. The whale has collapsable lungs that make it possible to deal with the crushing
                weight of deep water. There are multiple deep-diving beaked whales but the Cuvier's is the champion
                diver by hundreds of meters.</p>
