            Well that seemed unecessary. You are still standing in the same place but now you have rat on your shoe. You still see two nearly identical passages, one on the left, and one on the
            right. The passage on the right has a symbol of an arrow going up above the entry, while the passage on the
            left has a symbol of an arrow going down. Standing between the passages is a single rat, looking at you curiously. What do you do?
