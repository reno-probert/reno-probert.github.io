            You use your bardic charm to calm the ghostly apparition. It seems to respond positively to your musical
            talents or maybe it's your good looks. The ghost reaches out a spectral hand and points towards the stairs,
            allowing you to pass safely. You hurry down the stairs to the end of the hallway without further incident.
