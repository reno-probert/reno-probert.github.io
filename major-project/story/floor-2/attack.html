            You charge forward at the golem, weapon raised high. The golem senses your agression and charges toward you, it's footsteps cacking the floor below. You see a potential weakpoint at the base of the creature's neck but you know you will have to evade it's attacks first. The creature barrels toward you and is upon you in a moment.
