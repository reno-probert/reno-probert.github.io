            You begin viloently smashing your hammer into the stairs until they crumble beneath your mighty blows. You
            immediately begin to fall, questioning whether this was a good idea but what is smashed, is smashed. You
            crash down to the floor below in a heap. The cacauphonous noise seems to distrub some sort of creature as
            you hear a bellowing shout before looking up to see large stone golem standing above you.
