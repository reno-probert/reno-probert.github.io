            You put all of your energy into one final push, pouring everything you have at the adventurer. At first it
            seems he is able to block everything you try, but as you surge, he stumbles backward into the crystal
            platform, for a moment he seems to jolt before becoming still, just long enough to create an opening. You
            strike, and the adventurer falls to the ground lifeless. You have failed in your quest to save him, but you
            are alive. You see the orange crystal in front of you. What do you do?
