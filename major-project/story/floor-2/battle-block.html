            You attempt to take a defensive stance against the adventurer but his attacks are too strong. Hoping to wear
            him down you continue to block but as you do, tendrils of orange begin to spread from his weapon to yours.
            Before you know it orange crystals have begun to spread accross your skin. Suddenly you no longer have the
            urge to fight. Then you have no more urges at all as the orange crystal consumes your mind. <strong>Your adventure ends here.</strong>
