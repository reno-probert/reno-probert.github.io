            You manage to dodge the adventurer's attacks and reach the gem behind him. You reach out your hands to grab
            it but the moment you do, a sudden warm feeling envelopes your body. Before you know it orange crystals have
            begun to spread accross your skin. Suddenly you no longer have the urge to fight. Then you have no more
            urges at all as the orange crystal consumes your mind. <strong>Your adventure ends here.</strong>
