            You exit the rubble strewn room and head through a narrow passageway ending in an old wooden door. You open
            the door and see a dark room lit by an eerie orange glow. To your surprise standing in the room is the
            adventurer you were sent to find! You call out and he turns, and you notice something is wrong. Orange light
            reflects off his eyes and small orange crystals appear on his arm. Behind him you see a large orange
            crystal. "Leave this place!" he shouts, brandishing a scimitar. What do you do?
