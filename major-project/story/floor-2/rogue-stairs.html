            Really? A backflip on a spiral staircase? Unfortunately even as a super cool rogue you find yourself a victim of
            hubris, and the laws of physics. You hit your head hard on the stones suffering fractures to your occipital bone and
            several vertibrae. You lay on the stairs, unable to move, hoping another adventurer can come and find you soon. Out of the corner of your eye you see the rat judging you from a distance. <strong>Your adventure ends here.</strong>
