                <li>1&frac34; cups oat milk (or any dairy-free milk)</li>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Plug in your waffle iron and allow it to pre-heat.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon.</li>
                <li>In a large measuring cup (or another bowl), add the oat milk and the cooking oil.</li>
                <li>Separate the egg yolks and the egg whites by putting the whites into a small mixing bowl and setting
                    them aside. The egg yolks should be put into the measuring cup with the oat milk and oil.</li>
                <li>Whisk the oil, egg yolks, and oat milk until mixed.</li>
                <li>Poor the oat milk mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir until thoroughly mixed.
                    Some lumps are fine.</li>
                <li>Take the egg whites and beat with a mixer until they become white and fluffy. You will be able to
                    tell the egg whites are done when you remove the mixer and two small peaks are created and stay up.
                </li>
                <li>Gently fold the egg whites into the rest of your batter. Be sure not to overmix or the waffles will
                    lose fluffiness.</li>
                <li>Lightly grease the waffle iron with a brush of oil.</li>
                <li>Pour roughly 1 cup of the batter onto the waffle iron depending on the size of your waffle iron.
                </li>
                <li>Cook for around 4 minutes or until the waffle is golden brown. Serve with your favorite toppings.
                </li>
                <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, brushing oil on the waffle iron as needed.</li>
            </ol>
